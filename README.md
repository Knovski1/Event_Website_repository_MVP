# Event_Website_repository_MVP
This is the repository for the mvp of a event promotion website project

to utilise this code we recommend installing XXAMP, Apache and Mysql and copying the files over to run on localhost

*to use the reactive website design fully, you must connect the css to the php files through swapping the style sheet url*
